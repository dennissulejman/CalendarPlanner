# CalendarPlanner v. 1.0
This is my Calendar Planner which will let you create plans for certain dates.

The application is rather straight-forward. You create a user from which you can create, remove and show your plans.
Your plans will be ordered by their starting date. As you create a user, you choose a password that is hashed into the database.
I have used EF Core together with Microsoft SQL Server in order to configure the database Code-First.
As of this point, no bugs have been found but if you were to try this application and would find any, please report them!

Feel free to send feedback on possible changes/additions/other ideas!
